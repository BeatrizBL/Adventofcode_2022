# Advent of Code - 2022

In this repository you can find some proposed solutions to the 50 coding challenges from https://adventofcode.com/. Each day, starting from December 1st, two related challenges are published. The proposed solutions for each challenge can be found in the corresponding directory for that day.

The Readme of each day includes a **short explanation of the proposed solution**. Task descriptions can be found in the original link. The input files would be different for each user.

## Main concepts covered

List of interesting concepts and packages used on each day.
- Day 1 - Basic list comprehension.
- Day 2 - Circular lists and Modulo operator.
- Day 3 - Pipeline execution with `reduce`.
- Day 4 - Bitwise operations.
- Day 5 - Stacks with lists. Substring extraction using regular expressions.
- Day 6 - Rolling windows.
- Day 7 - Object Oriented Programing, leveraging subclasses inheritance. Tree and Graph structures.
- Day 8 - Matrices with `numpy.array`.
- Day 9 - Sparse, unbounded matrices with dictionaries. Basic Object Oriented Programing.
- Day 10 - Basic OOP.
