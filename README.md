# Advent of Code - 2022

In this repository you can find some proposed solutions to the 50 coding challenges from https://adventofcode.com/. Each day, starting from December 1st, two related challenges are published. The proposed solutions for each challenge can be found in the corresponding directory for that day.

The Readme of each day includes a **short explanation of the proposed solution**. Task descriptions can be found in the original link. The input files would be different for each user.

## Main concepts covered

List of interesting concepts and packages used on each day.
- Day 1 - Basic list comprehension.
- Day 2 - Circular lists and Modulo operator.
- Day 3 - Pipeline execution with `reduce`. ASCII values with `ord`.
- Day 4 - Bitwise operations.
- Day 5 - Stacks with lists. Substring extraction using regular expressions.
- Day 6 - Rolling windows.
- Day 7 - Object Oriented Programing, leveraging subclasses inheritance. Tree and Graph structures.
- Day 8 - Matrices with `numpy.array`.
- Day 9 - Sparse, unbounded matrices with dictionaries. Basic Object Oriented Programing.
- Day 10 - Basic OOP.
- Day 11 - Besides basic OOP:
  - `eval` method to transform strings into callables.
  - Queues with lists.
  - Least Common Multiple using `math.gcd`.
  - Regular expressions.
- Day 12 - Breadth-First Search to find shortest path of directed graphs.
- Day 13 - Recursive methods. Bubble Sort for non numerical lists.
- Day 14 - Sparse matrices with dictionaries.
- Day 15 - Manhattan distance. Python profiling for code optimization.
- **Day 16** - Besides Graph structure:
  - A* algorithm to find optimal path.
  - Graph visualization tools.
- Day 17 - Pandas DataFrame visualization into **an animated GIF**.
- Day 18 - Breadth search on a 3D grid using a queue.
- **Day 19** - Integer linear programming.
